# Sys-con

#### Connect any USB controller to your Nintendo Switch ! 
***Support any controller***: PC controllers, Wheels, Dualshock 3, Dualshock 4, Dualsense (PS5), XBOX, XBOX360, XBOXONE, ...

## Description
Sys-con is a Nintendo Switch module that adds support for all HID and XID joysticks and gamepads to the Nintendo Switch.
Only **USB** connection is supported (For Bluetooth connection prefer to use ndeadly's [MissionControl](https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControl))

## Installation
Download the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/o0zz/sys-con/releases). Extract it to your SD card root folder and boot/reboot your switch.

## Configuration
sys-con comes with a configuration folder located in `/config/sys-con/`. It contains configuration for controllers (Button mappings, sticks configuration, triggers configuration, deadzones...).

The configuration is loaded in the following way:
- The `[global]` section is only loaded once, when the switch boots, so if you want to apply a setting, you have to reboot the switch.
- Other sections are for controller configuration, they are loaded each time you plug a controller, so if you want to apply a setting you will have to unplug and then replug your controller to apply it.

When a new controller is plugged, the configuration is loaded in below order
1. First it load the `[default]` section
2. Then it will load the `[VID-PID]` section
3. If `[VID-PID]` contains a `[profile]`, it will load the `[profile]` then load `[VID-PID]`.

In other words, the loading order is: `[Default]` `[Profile]` `[VID-PID]`.
If you want to override a setting for only 1 controller, it's adviced to change the configuration in `[VID-PID]` in order to not impact others controllers

## Logs
In case of issue, you can look at the logs in `/config/sys-con/log.txt` (On your SDCard).
The logs are automatically created with a log level equal to Info.
For more verbose logs, edit `/config/sys-con/config.ini` and set:

```
[global]
log_level=0
```

Reboot the Nintendo Switch.

## Configure a controller
When a new controller is connected, sys-con tries to determine the best profile for this new controller.
In most cases the dpad and joystick will work fine, the buttons may not be mapped correctly by default (and in rare cases the right stick may be reversed or not working). If this is the case, you will need to map the buttons yourself using the procedure below:

### Method 1 (Directly from the switch)

1. Connect your controller to the switch
2. On the switch, go to Settings -> Controllers & Sensors > Test Input Devices
3. Press the button and try to understand the correct mapping.
3. On your SDCard, edit `/config/sys-con/config.ini` and find your controller's `[vid-pid]` section (most likely at the end of the file).
Note: A new section is automatically created if the controller is not known to sys-con. This means that your controller will most likely be the last one (at the end).

Typical configuration will look like
```
[0810-0001]
B=1
A=2
Y=3
X=4
L=5
R=6
ZL=7
ZR=8
minus=9
plus=10
home=11
capture=12
rstick_left=-Rz
rstick_right=+Rz
rstick_up=+Z
rstick_down=-Z
``` 
Where ButtonName (A, B, Y, X ...) need to be assign to a ButtonID (1,2,3,4,5 ...)
Now, according to what you found in step 2, you need to match ButtonName with ButtonID.
For example, if you found that 'B' is reversed with 'A', just swap the ButtonID:
```
B=2
A=1
```

### Method 2 (From a windows PC)
1. Connect your controller to your PC
2. Go to 'Control Panel' > 'Device Manager' and find your USB device under 'Human Interface Devices'.
3. Double click on the device or right click and select Properties.
4. Go to the 'Details' tab and select 'Hardware IDs' to view its PID and VID. The PID/VID should look like "HID\VID_0810&PID_0001&...", which becomes: `[0810-0001]`.
5. Open "joy.cpl" (either from Win+R or directly from the Start menu). 
6. Select your controller and click on "Properties"
7. Here you should see a panel with ButtonID (1, 2, 3 ...), press the button and make a note of them (which button is assigned to which ID).
8. Now edit `/config/sys-con/config.ini` on your switch sdcard and edit your controller's vid-pid section:

```
[0810-0001]
B=3
A=2
Y=4
X=1
L=7
R=8
ZL=5
ZR=6
minus=9
plus=10
home=11
capture=12
rstick_left=-Z
rstick_right=+Z
rstick_up=+Rz
rstick_down=-Rz
```
Where ButtonID (1,2,3,4, ...) is the key ID noted in step 7.
Note: Depending to the controller, this windows procedure might not works. If the mapping is incorrect, switch to Method 1

### Button mapping

The following is the complete list of mappable buttons for the Switch controller:
```
lstick_left=
lstick_right=
lstick_up=
lstick_down=
rstick_left=
rstick_right=
rstick_up=
rstick_down=
B=
A=
Y=
X=
L=
R=
ZL=
ZR=
minus=
plus=
lstick_click=
rstick_click=
dpad_up=
dpad_down=
dpad_left=
dpad_right=
capture=
home=
simulate_<BUTTON>=
```

**Possible Values:**

 - **1 to 31**: Represent the Button ID of the controller
 - **Z, -Z, Rz, -Rz, Rx, -Rx, Ry, -Ry, Slider, -Slider, Dial, -Dial**: Represents the analog inputs (e.g., joystick, slider).
 - **32 to 35**:  Represents the hat switch (D-Pad) directions:
   - `32` — `dpad_up`
   - `33` — `dpad_down`
   - `34` — `dpad_left`
   - `35` — `dpad_right`

### Deadzone & Factor configuration

You can adjust the deadzone and factor for each analog input to fine-tune the controller response.
 - **Deadzone:** Defines a region around the neutral position of an analog stick where inputs are ignored, preventing unintended movements.
 - **Factor:** Adjusts the input scaling, allowing for compensation if the controller isn't reaching its full range of motion.

```
deadzone_x=20
deadzone_y=20
deadzone_z=20
deadzone_rz=20
deadzone_rx=5
deadzone_ry=5
deadzone_slider=20
deadzone_dial=20

factor_x=100
factor_y=100
factor_z=100
factor_rz=100
factor_rx=100
factor_ry=100
factor_slider=100
factor_dial=100
```

All these values are in percentages
- Typical deadzone range: 0% to 30%
- Typical Factor range: 100% to 150%

### Home & Capture shortcuts
By default, the **HOME** and **CAPTURE** can be triggered by pressing `Minus + DPAD_UP` and `Minus + DPAD_DOWN`, respectively. Minus button is often mapped to the select button.

### Simulating buttons
You can simulate buttons by combining multiple button presses.
For example:
```
simulate_L=minus+plus
simulate_A=L+R
simulate_rstick_click=ZL
```
This configuration allows you to trigger specific buttons using combinations of other buttons, offering more flexibility in custom mappings.

## Building (For developers)

Don't download the project as ZIP as it will not copy submodules properly, prefer a git clone:
`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/o0Zz/sys-con.git`

Like all other switch projects, you will need [devkitA64](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) set up on your system.

### Setup your environment on windows:
Full procedure here: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman

1) Add these variables to your environement system
```
DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM
DEVKITPPC=/opt/devkitpro/devkitPPC
```

2) Download and install msys64: https://www.msys2.org/#installation
3) Open msys and type:
```
pacman-key --recv BC26F752D25B92CE272E0F44F7FD5492264BB9D0 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
pacman-key --lsign BC26F752D25B92CE272E0F44F7FD5492264BB9D0
wget https://pkg.devkitpro.org/devkitpro-keyring.pkg.tar.xz
pacman -U devkitpro-keyring.pkg.tar.xz
echo "[dkp-libs]" >> /etc/pacman.conf
echo "Server = https://pkg.devkitpro.org/packages" >> /etc/pacman.conf
echo "[dkp-windows]" >> /etc/pacman.conf
echo "Server = https://pkg.devkitpro.org/packages/windows/$arch/" >> /etc/pacman.conf
pacman -Syu
pacman -S switch-dev
```

### Install extra dependencies for sys-con
Open MSYS2 console from devkitA64 and type below commands:
```
pacman -S make
pacman -S git
pacman -S switch-libjpeg-turbo
pacman -S zip
pacman -S diffutils
make -C lib/libnx install
```

### Build the project with Visual Studio Code

You need to select msys as default terminal in VSCode:
```
CTRL+SHIFT+P
Select "Terminal: Select default profile"
Select "msys2"
```

Then build:
```
CTRL+SHIFT+P
